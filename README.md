# RSA-Encryption-Visualizer

This is a simple python program I wrote while trying to learn more about RSA encryption. It is designed to make a somewhat interactive experience for the user by stepping through the program via prompts, and then printing as much of the math and process behind it to terminal without making it unusable. 
The program is best ran from the terminal. It will work with any operating system as well. If you intend to decrypt your encrypted message, you must be sure not to delete your public and private key files generated during the encryption process, as in RSA the keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. 

To make it more clear:
1. Save all .py files in the same directory
2. Run the main file "RSA_protocol_visualizer.py" and begin with encryption
3. Choose a message to encrypt. Do not use any exotic symbols as I used a very basic character set
4. Follow the prompts through the encryption process
5. Select 'no' to deleting your key files
6. Run the program again and select decrypt
7. Copy and paste the entire encrypted message when asked to give your encrypted message
8. Follow the prompts through the decryption process

Thank you! I hope someone will find this useful, any feeback is greatly appreciated.
